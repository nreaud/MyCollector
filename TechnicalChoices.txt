JSON file Enough, no need database:
When deserializing the stored current state only to get one manga state, i 
chosed to read all the json file, then get only what i wanted, i could have 
stored the data differently (database, noSql, ...) but i chosed not to cause i 
won't have too many mangas, so no to many datas, reading a small json file is 
good enough for me
